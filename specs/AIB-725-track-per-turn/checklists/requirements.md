# Specification Quality Checklist: Track Per-Turn Context Size on Jobs

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] Auto-Resolved Decisions section captures policy, confidence, trade-offs, and reviewer notes (or explicitly states none)

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] Any forced CONSERVATIVE fallbacks are documented with rationale

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/ai-board.clarify` or `/ai-board.plan`
- Threshold values in FR-007 are deliberately expressed as "warning / danger" bands rather than fixed token counts, so tuning after two to three weeks of data does not require a spec revision.
- Field naming suggestions in Auto-Resolved Decisions (`peakContextTokens`, etc.) are non-binding; planning phase may choose final names.
