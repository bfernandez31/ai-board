# Specification Quality Checklist: Add Mistral (vibe CLI) as Third AI Agent Provider

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] Auto-Resolved Decisions section captures policy, confidence, trade-offs, and reviewer notes

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] Any forced CONSERVATIVE fallbacks are documented with rationale

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 5 auto-resolved decisions documented with CONSERVATIVE policy (AUTO scoring: netScore=+5, confidence=High)
- No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers — the ticket description was comprehensive enough to resolve all ambiguities
- Telemetry trace ingestion (FR-009) is the most architecturally significant addition; reviewer should validate OTLP trace format assumptions
- Spec references "vibe CLI" and "AGENTS.md" as product names, not implementation details
