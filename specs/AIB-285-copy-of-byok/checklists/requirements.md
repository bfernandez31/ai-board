# Specification Quality Checklist: BYOK - Bring Your Own API Key

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] Auto-Resolved Decisions section captures policy, confidence, trade-offs, and reviewer notes

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] Any forced CONSERVATIVE fallbacks are documented with rationale

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All 5 auto-resolved decisions used AUTO policy which aligned with CONSERVATIVE due to strong security signals (score 15+). No fallbacks were triggered.
- Backward compatibility for ai-board self-managed project is explicitly addressed in FR-008 and SC-004.
- Security requirements are comprehensive: encryption at rest (FR-002), no logs (FR-010), no client-side leakage (FR-011), owner-only access (FR-012).
