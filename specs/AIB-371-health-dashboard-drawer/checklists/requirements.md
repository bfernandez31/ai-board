# Specification Quality Checklist: Health Dashboard — Scan Detail Drawer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-29
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed
- [x] Auto-Resolved Decisions section captures policy, confidence, trade-offs, and reviewer notes

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
- [x] Any forced CONSERVATIVE fallbacks are documented with rationale

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation. Spec is ready for `/ai-board.clarify` or `/ai-board.plan`.
- 5 auto-resolved decisions documented with CONSERVATIVE fallback policy (low AUTO confidence).
- Score trend chart deferred to future iteration (documented in decision #5).
- Report JSON schema definition is flagged as a planning-phase deliverable (documented in decision #2 and Assumptions).
